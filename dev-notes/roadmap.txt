Roadmap

Cleanup of files. Maybe categorize commands into folders??

Features added:

> > LISTS
Interacting with the event list through:
  !add-event
  !remove-event
  !pick-event
  !events

Interacting with the watchlist through:
  !rec - add to candidates list
  !shows - displays list of shows (used for setup)
  !update ID, # - updates the progress marker
  !finish ID - adds show to finished section
  !hiatus ID - adds winner to hiatus section
  !banish ID - adds winner to banished section
  !remove - scans all JSON and removes item


Duplicate prevention by checking through lowercasing.
