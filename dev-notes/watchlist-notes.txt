The structure of watchlist.json is explained here

One watchlist OBJECT contains ARRAYS.
The "winners" array: contains objects with a NAME and EPISODE
The "candidates" array: contains objects with a NAME and SCORE
The "notAnime" array: contains only names
The "finished" array: contains only names
The "onPause" array: contains objects with a NAME and EPISODE
The "banished" array: contains only names
The "rollTide" array: contains only names

Perhaps I could use SQL on this instead of JSON files, but this is a good
exercise to learn how to use JSON.
